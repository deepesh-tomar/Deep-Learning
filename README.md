# Deep-Learning

1)For binary clasification, a simple deep learnig model is MP Neuron (MeCulloch Pitts Neuron) model.
2)Dataset used is Breast_cancer from sklearn.
3)Task is to predict if someone is likely to or has Breast cancer.
4)Along with MP neuron, this also include Perceptron deep learning model so to compare accuracy side by side.
5)MP neuron and perceptron are models used for linear data.
